# Media

Media tab displays media files under [Media Folder Path](https://github.com/0xsuk/agitcms/blob/main/Settings.md#media).

Click `COPY` to copy the url path of the media content.

Things to note
- You only can copy the public path of an image
- You can't, for example, click on image to get maximized view
- You can't drag an image and drop here to upload it.

# Sidebar
- Click on home icon to navigate to home
- Click on `<` `>` to navigate history
- Click on reload icon to reload
- Pinned files are listed. I think this feature is pretty useless if you use browser's bookmark feature.
