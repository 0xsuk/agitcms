### Information I collect and what I use it for

I run [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) analytics on gethyas.com. The following information is collected:

- __Page URL__. I track the page URL of each page view on this website. I use this to understand which pages have been viewed and how many times a particular page has been viewed. For example: _https://gethyas.com/_.
- __HTTP Referrer__. I use the referrer string to understand the number of visitors referred to this website from links on other sites. For example: _https://github.com/_.
- __Browser__. I use this to understand what browsers people use when visiting this website. This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header. The full User-Agent is discarded. For example: _Chrome_.
- __Operating system__. I use this to understand what operating systems people use when visiting this website. I only use the brand of the operating system and don’t include the version number or any other details. This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header. The full User-Agent is discarded. For example: _GNU/Linux_.
- __Device type__. I use this to understand what devices people use when visiting this website. This is derived from window.innerWidth. The actual width of the browser in pixels is discarded. For example: _Desktop_.
- __Visitor Country__. I look up the visitor’s country using the IP address. I do not track anything more granular than the country of origin and the IP address of the visitor is discarded. I never store IP addresses in my database or logs. For example: _Canada_.
