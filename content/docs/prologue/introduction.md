## Why Hyas?

Six reasons why you should use Hyas:

1. __Security aware__. Get A+ scores on [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/hyas.netlify.app) out of the box. Easily change the default Security Headers to suit your needs.

2. __Fast by default__. Get 100 scores on [Google Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=8b7aec005ae7b9e128ad5c4e2f125fea) by default. Hyas removes unused css, prefetches links, and lazy loads images.

3. __SEO-ready__. Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards. Or easily change the SEO settings to your liking.

4. __Development tools__. Code with confidence. Check styles, scripts, and markdown for errors and fix automatically or manually.

5. __Bootstrap framework__. Build robust, flexible, and intuitive websites with Bootstrap. Or use any other front-end framework if you prefer.

6. __Netlify-ready__. Deploy to Netlify with sensible defaults. Easily use Netlify Functions, Netlify Redirects, and Netlify Headers.

## Prerequisites

Make sure all dependencies have been installed:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) >= 0.75.1/extended
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 14.12.0
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= 1.22.5 (recommended)

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="npm (comes with Node.js) and Yarn are both Node.js package managers. <a href=\"https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/\">Yarn</a> is faster, more reliable, and more secure than npm." >}}
