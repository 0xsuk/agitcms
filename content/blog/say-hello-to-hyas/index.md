## Solid as a rock

Some website projects require a solid starting point. With a great developer experience and a sound user experience. Sometimes you just don't want to start from scratch. That's why I created Hyas üíö

## This is how we do it

Making use of the power of Hugo. Following best practices for performance, SEO and security. Optimized for the Netlify platform. And always flexible, so you can easily make it your own.

## Say Whaaat?

- Security aware
- Fast by default ‚ö°Ô∏è
- SEO-ready
- Development tools (linting, cleaning)
- Bootstrap framework
- Netlify-ready (functions, redirects, headers)
