# Agit CMS

Frontend interface for static sites.  
Agit CMS is a supersimple & extensible desktop app built for better writing experience.  

/eɪdʒɪt/  
# Who Agit CMS is for
Agit CMS is recommended for those
- who already have static sites, and write contents in markdown (ANY static site generator supported! Hugo, Jekyll, Next.js, Gatsby.js...)
- who need high customizability on markdown editor (custom parsing, image pasting/resize, custom snippet...)
- who need nice frontmatter editor (Date picker, true/false toggler, and more!)

Agit CMS may not be for those who needs to co-edit contents.  This project is meant for individuals who value writing experience.  
  
Still under active development!!
